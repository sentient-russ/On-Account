### Overview:
On-Account is a double-entry, US currency-based accounting system that begain development in late 2024. It is our hope that you are able to use it as a foundational system and possibly upgrade it with inventory, project management, time tracking... There really are so many possibilities. In its current form the On-Account software is not and should not be considered production ready.  As you may see from our commit history, we are progressively moving towards a product that is.  Please stay tuned. We welcome contributions via issue submission, testing, documentation, or to the code base.
